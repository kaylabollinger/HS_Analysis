# Hearthstone Analysis: Power Creep

## Data Sources:
The main source of data used here is Hearthstone card data via [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/omgvamp/api/hearthstone). 
The other source of data was scraped from decks posted publicly on [Hearthstone Top Decks](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/). 
This data was used as an indication of which hearthstone cards are considered 
good/powerful (if a card is used in a highly rated deck, then we consider it 
powerful). Hearthstone Top Decks is an awesome site for Hearthstone related articles, 
news, guides, and other content.
